				<h2>Gluten Free Zone</h2>
				<p>Gluten Free Zone is a smart phone application that allows users to easily scan a products barcode, 
				and find out if it is safe to eat. Gluten Free Zone is targeted at users with celiac disease as well as others who wish to avoid gluten. 
				Gluten Free Zone provides accurate information about the products by partnering with the manufacturers of the food. 	
				This is valuable to the manufacturers because their product has a much higher value to the customer if the customer can 
				be certain that it is okay for them to eat.

				<h2>Kaitlyn Huinink</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am Kaitlyn Huinink currently studying Kinesiology and Physical Education. 
				I have a strong passion for nutrition and health, and love learning new things in this area.
				Recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, I knew something much simpler needed to be made available
				to help individuals such as myself make an easy transition into this new diet. 
				Ridding gluten in a diet involves making many changes in ones lifestyle, so anything to
				help ease this transition is helpful. With my background in Kinesiology and my passion for health, 
				the idea of gluten free zone emerged.

				Hi, I'm Jake Buller and I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at Laurier. I love buidling new and exciting applications
        and working with latest techonologies and I'm looking forward to finish my degree this year to be a full time developer. In 
        my free time I'm a musician, I've been playing the piano and guitar most of my life. This project is an endevaour that has 
        taught me a lot more than I could have guessed. Buidling a business is a lot more than having a great idea through the 
        Laurier Launchpad program we have turned Gluten Free Zone into a business. I hope you find the app useful and thanks for 
        checking out our website!
